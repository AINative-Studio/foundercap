### Sprint 1: Project Setup & Core Architecture

**Goal:** Lay the foundation for a scalable, maintainable agent.
**Deliverables:**

* Code repo with CI/CD pipeline configured
* Skeleton services: Scheduler, Scraper interface, Updater interface
* Configuration management for API keys (LinkedIn, Crunchbase, ZeroDB, Airtable)
* Basic “Hello World” cron job that logs to console
  **Acceptance Criteria:**
* Pipeline runs on push, lints & tests pass
* Env vars for all integrations are securely loaded
* Demonstrable scheduler trigger

---

### Sprint 2: Crunchbase Scraper Module

**Goal:** Build and validate the Crunchbase‐fetching component.
**Deliverables:**

* `fetch_crunchbase(permalink)` implementation using official API or HTML fallback
* Unit tests mocking both success and rate‐limit/failure scenarios
* Local caching layer for per‐run deduplication
  **Acceptance Criteria:**
* Module returns normalized JSON → `{ total_funding, funding_stage, investors[] }`
* 100% test coverage for success/failure paths
* Configurable API key & rate‐limit backoff

---

### Sprint 3: LinkedIn Scraper Module

**Goal:** Develop reliable LinkedIn data extraction.
**Deliverables:**

* Integration with LinkedIn Company Lookup API **or** Playwright‐based scraper
* Fields extracted: `{ operating_status, website, headcount_estimate, about_text }`
* Error handling for login, CAPTCHA, throttling
* Unit + smoke tests
  **Acceptance Criteria:**
* Extracts correct data for a sample set of companies
* Retries or skips gracefully on bot‐detection errors
* Logs actionable errors

---

### Sprint 4: Google Alerts Integration

**Goal:** Ingest press/funding announcements via RSS → webhook.
**Deliverables:**

* Zapier‐based RSS→Webhook pipeline or custom RSS poller
* Endpoint to receive alert payloads (normalize to `{ company_name, url, title, published_at }`)
* Storage of raw alerts in a simple queue/db table
  **Acceptance Criteria:**
* New alerts appear in queue within expected latency
* Deduplication logic prevents repeat processing

---

### Sprint 5: Change Detection & Diff Engine

**Goal:** Compare freshly scraped data vs. last‐known snapshot.
**Deliverables:**

* Snapshot store (ZeroDB / local cache) read/write interface
* Diff algorithm producing only changed fields with old/new values
* Unit tests covering added/removed/updated field scenarios
  **Acceptance Criteria:**
* Given two JSON documents, diff outputs minimal patch set
* Snapshots persisted upon each successful run

---

### Sprint 6: Airtable & ZeroDB Updaters

**Goal:** Wire diffs into the two data stores.
**Deliverables:**

* Airtable PATCH logic for changed fields
* ZeroDB upsert via `/records` and cache‐invalidate via `/cache/invalidate`
* End‐to‐end integration test (mock external APIs)
  **Acceptance Criteria:**
* Airtable record reflects diffs after run
* ZeroDB document updated with new snapshot & vector recalculation
* Agent logs success/failure per record

---

### Sprint 7: Dashboard Cache Invalidation & Integration

**Goal:** Ensure your dashboard shows fresh data immediately after updates.
**Deliverables:**

* Backend endpoint (e.g. `POST /api/zero-db/refreshCache`) invoked per update
* Frontend hook to refresh table/data on cache‐invalidated events
* Automated test of full chain: scrape → diff → update → UI reflects change
  **Acceptance Criteria:**
* UI data matches Airtable/ZeroDB within seconds of an update
* No stale data shown after multiple back‐to‐back runs

---

### Sprint 8: Logging, Monitoring & Alerting

**Goal:** Make operations transparent and failure‐resilient.
**Deliverables:**

* Centralized logging (e.g. Sentry or ELK) for scraping & updates
* Health‐check endpoint (e.g. `/healthz`) aggregated in scheduler
* Notification hooks (Slack/email) on critical failures or thresholds (e.g. >10% scrape errors)
  **Acceptance Criteria:**
* Alerts sent on repeated failures or high‐error rates
* Ops can inspect logs and trace a record’s lifecycle

---

### Sprint 9: Security, Performance & Hardening

**Goal:** Lock down credentials and scale to production volumes.
**Deliverables:**

* Secrets management (e.g. AWS Secrets Manager, Vault) integration
* Rate‐limiters and concurrency controls per module
* Benchmarking: sync 1000 companies under X minutes
* Penetration test checklist & remediate findings
  **Acceptance Criteria:**
* System meets performance targets
* No plaintext credentials in code or logs
* Load testing reveals no memory leaks

---

### Sprint 10: Documentation & Handoff

**Goal:** Deliver a fully documented, supportable system.
**Deliverables:**

* README with setup, run instructions, env variables
* API docs for internal endpoints (OpenAPI spec)
* Runbook: deploy, rollback, debug steps
* Knowledge‐transfer session & recorded demo
  **Acceptance Criteria:**
* A new engineer can deploy from zero using docs alone
* Stakeholders sign off on demos and runbook accuracy
